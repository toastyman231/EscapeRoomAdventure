  text: 'How to use the Jefferson Disk:\\n\\n

    You will need a "key" for the
    disk, which is a sequence of numbers. These represent the order of the disks.
    Assume the disks are ordered 1 -5, left to right. You can swap disks by clicking
    on them. Don''t forget which disk is which once you start moving them around!\\n\\n

    Once
    you have the disks in the correct order, rotate them so the message you wish
    to decode is between the arrows. Now all you have to do is rotate the entire
    disk until you find the row that spells out the real message!\\n\\n

    This
    Jefferson Disk will provide the first digit of the door code.'
