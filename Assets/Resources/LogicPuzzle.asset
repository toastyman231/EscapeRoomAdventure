  text: "Kevin, Daniel, Brandon, and Stella are attending a party, and each of them
    have brought a gift for the host. Their gifts are all different, and each of
    them weighs a different amount. Additionally, they are each wearing a different
    color outfit, and each drove a different car to the party.\\\\n\\\\nKevin, whose
    item weighs 5 units, begins to brag that he drives the fanciest car. Stella is
    wearing a green suit, and she remarks that at least she\u2019s not driving the
    Toyota. Daniel, who does not drive a Honda and did not bring the golden apple,
    arrives and thinks to himself that he\u2019s glad he\u2019s not the one wearing
    the ugly purple suit. Brandon arrives last and notices that he brought the lightest
    gift.\\\\n\\\\nHearing this, the guest wearing blue realizes they brought a gift
    lighter than at least two other gifts. The guest wearing purple interrupts to
    comment that their gift is heavier than only one other person\u2019s gift. The
    guest driving the Honda, who is wearing a primary color, asks the others how
    much their gifts weigh. The guest driving the Chevy does a few quick measurements
    and announces their gift is heavier than Kevin\u2019s gift, but lighter than
    Daniel\u2019s gift. The guest driving the BMW and the guest in red weigh their
    gifts and are pleased to find that they add up to a nice 15 units.\\\\n\\\\nBy
    the end of the party, Stella\u2019s gift has been stolen. The weight of her item
    is the third digit of the combination. "
