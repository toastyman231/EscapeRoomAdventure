  text: I can't believe they've given me free range to do whatever I want with the
    subject!\\nSo many advances in sience could be made! Seeing the subjects' reactions
    to my tests could prove quite valuable...\\nSo far I've come up with a few cool
    tests I could run to measure their intelligence. A simple lojic puzzle, and a
    few easy mazes, nothing too bad.\\nI even have a location picked out and everything!
    I just need too remember not to leave these notes in here once I'm done! It wuold
    be bad if the subject caught on before they realized they were being tested on...\\nWemll
    anyway, I'll come back to this tomorrow. I'm famished! I could go for a nice
    burger right about now...
